### Research Focus

My primary research interest lies in the development and investigation of learning priors for deep neural networks. This work aims to facilitate the robust transfer of learned models across diverse data domains, tasks, and modalities. Methodologically, my research employs meta-learning techniques, as well as differentiable and non-differentiable learning paradigms. Adversarial learning and multi-modal learning frameworks are also integral to my work.

Key areas of additional focus include the study of inductive biases in machine learning models, the scalability of learning algorithms, computational efficiency, and the incorporation of memory structures into neural networks. I also explore optimization techniques inspired by evolutionary computation.

#### Research Philosophy

My research operates under a pragmatic framework, focusing on identifying high-leverage areas that can benefit from targeted investigation. This allows for a more efficient allocation of both computational and intellectual resources. In a nod to both evolutionary computation and the Pareto Principle, you could say I'm interested in identifying the "fittest" 20% of research angles that yield 80% of the meaningful results.
